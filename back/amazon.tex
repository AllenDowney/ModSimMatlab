Writers are not performance artists. While there are book signings and public readings, most writers (and readers) follow their passion alone in their homes.

\textit{What applause is for the musician, \textbf{reviews} are for the writer.} 

\textit{Books create a community among readers}; you can share your thoughts among all those who will or have read the book.

\textbf{Leave a thoughtful honest review and help me to create such a community on the platform on which you have acquired this book.} \textit{What did you like, what can be improved? To whom would you recommend it?} 

Thank you, also in the name of all the other readers who will be able to better decide whether this book is right for them or not! A positive review will increase the reach of the book, a negative review will improve the quality of the next book. I welcome both!
