% Suppose we put one cell on a petri dish (which supplies a nutrient
% that allows the cell to reproduce).  During each generation time,
% each cell divides into two cells, so the number of new cells
% equals the number of current cells.

% Now suppose that each cell consumes one unit of nutrient during
% each generation time, and suppose that the petri dish contains
% 1000 units of nutrient.

% When the food is exhausted, the cells become dormant and stop
% dividing.  Plot the number of cells over time.

% Suppose that the natural death rate of cells is 10%.
% Plot the number of cells over time.
