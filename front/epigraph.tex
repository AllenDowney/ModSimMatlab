\chapter{Introduction}

Here you can write an introductory paragraph that sets the theme of the book. It does not necessarily have to describe what the book is about, it can also be a significant quote.

In the same way [\dots], you will never know what your husband looks like unless you try to draw him, and you will never understand him unless you try to write his story.\par\mbox{}\hfill \emdash{}Brenda Ueland\index{Ueland, Brenda}\index{Gogh, Van}, \citetitle{ifyouwanttowrite}\index{@\citetitle{ifyouwanttowrite}} \ifxetex\label{gogh-sky-quote}\else\citep[pp.~23--24]{ifyouwanttowrite}\fi\par\end{myquotation}}
