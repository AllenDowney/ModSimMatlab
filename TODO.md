This is a list of things that need doing. A **!!!** next to an item indicates
that the item must be resolved before the current branch can be merged into
**stable**.

## Easier items

+ In the "Functions" chapter, there is a section called "Documentation", which
doesn't use MATLAB best-practices for function docstrings; modify this to be
consistent with the style guide.
+ Label the axes for the plots in the book. (E.g., in the "Second Order
Systems" chapter.)

## Harder items

+ Make sure every single line of output is written in a consistent
  style. There is currently a discrepancy between the earlier and later
  chapters of the book.
+ Update makefile with option to compile figures.
